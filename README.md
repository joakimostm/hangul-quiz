# Hangul Quiz

## Introduction
***Hangul Quiz*** is a tool that I created in order to help me memorize Korean Hangul.

Similar tools exists for Japanese Kana but I was not able to find one for Korean so I decided to make my own and learn about web apps and Vue.js in the process.


## Instructions
The live version can be accessed [here](https://joakimostm.github.io/hangul-quiz/)

Type the romanized version of the displayed Hangul character and press Enter.

The difficulty settings changes the composition of the character (number of consonants).<br>
Hover over the difficulty setting to see more info.

You can also hover over the Hangul to see the reading.

## Acknowledgements
Hangul Quiz was made with the help of:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [kroman](https://github.com/zhangkaiyulw/kroman-js) - For romanization of Hangul characters
